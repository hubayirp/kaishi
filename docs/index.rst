Kaishi
==================================

Kaishi is a toolkit to accelerate the initial phases of exploratory data analysis, as well as to enable rapid dataset preparation for downstream tasks.

More simply, Kaishi helps you automate steps to get from a raw dataset (in the form of a directory of files) to something that's usable for machine
learning, or any other task you may need a clean dataset for.
